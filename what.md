title: What We Do
---

Our mission is to improve diversity within the [Scala][scala] community and within the wider programming community.

What this means in practice is:

* We run a meetup where we learn to program.
* We create course material that is freely available so you can learn on your own and run your own meetup.
* We understand the importance of other people in learning and in one's career, so we create a community connecting programmers of many different levels of experience and seniority in a supportive environment.

ScalaBridge London is community run, meaning is run by the people it serves. We have an informal management structure. If the need arises we'll formalize it. Anyone can get involved with decision making if they're interested, but there is no requirement to do so.

We aren't the diversity police. Our teaching is aimed at those underrepresented in the programming community but we're not making a ruling on who does and doesn't belong. If you think you belong you probably do.


## A Bit of History

We started in 2019 and run until COVID made it impossible to continue. We then took a break at the end of 2020. Now in 2023 we're starting up again. This means things are a little bit in flux as we work out how to do what we want to do in this new context.

We intend to run ScalaBridge London as a two-year experiment, to see it's possible to deliver on our vision in a sustainable way. After two years we'll make a decision about the long term future.
