Hosts provide the venues where we hold ScalaBridge London events. Our typical hosts are companies using Scala located in central London. Here we have collected information for potential hosts.


## What We Ask For From Hosts

- We need space for around 30 attendees. Attendence will towards the higher end at the start of a semester, so if your space is smaller consider hosting towards the end of a semester. As we work in small groups it is not essential that everyone is seated in the same room.
- Hosts usually, but not always, provide food. A range of options, particularly vegetarian and gluten-free, is appreciated.
- We need WiFi, power outlets, and somewhere to sit and work. The seating arrangement is not important, but small groups is ideal if possible.
- We usually run 6-9pm.


## What Hosts Receive

Most companies host ScalaBridge because it's a way of giving back to the Scala community in London. A very direct benefit for hosts is potentially hiring from ScalaBridge attendees. This has already happened in our first season.

At the start of a session the host usually gives a brief (max 10 minutes) overview of the kind of work they do in Scala, and any open positions.
