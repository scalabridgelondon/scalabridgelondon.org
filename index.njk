            <h3>What is ScalaBridge London?</h3>
            <p>ScalaBridge London's mission is to improve diversity within the Scala community and within the wider programming community. Delivering our mission builds on four pillars:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Programming: learning programming is the main way we spend our time. We have a <a href="/curriculum">curriculum</a> aimed at those with no or little programming experience, but can also help more experienced developers.</li>
              <li>Diversity: our efforts emphasize those currently underrepresented within the technology industry. We run in-person sessions in London, and online sessions that are open to anyone around the world.</li>
              <li>Community: we are a welcoming and supportive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">community of practice</a> bringing together <a href="/students">students</a> and <a href="/mentors">experienced industry developers</a>. Furthermore, ScalaBridge London is a community-run organization. This means our members volunteer to run it, and it's completely free to attend.</li>
              <li>Scala: <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is the programming language we use. This is partly because the ScalaBridge London founders have a background in Scala, partly because there is a strong Scala community in London with a large number of employers, and partly because Scala lets us tackle a wide variety of different problems without having to learn different languages.</li>
            </ol>
