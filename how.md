title: How We Do What We Do
---

[What we do](/what) describes the goals of the group. This page describes how our processes work.


## Community

The [ScalaBridge discord][discord] is where we hang out online. (If the signup link has expired please email {% email %} and we'll create a new one.) We also use [meetup] to announce events and to market the group.


## Meetings

We run two types of meetings:

1. In-person meetings. Usually hosted by a company in central London that uses Scala (and therefore is a potential employer). 
2. Online meetings. Accessible to all, so long as you can make the time.

We meet every two weeks, alternating between in-person and online events. Some of you are looking to change careers, and are no doubt in a hurry. On the other hand, we need to set a schedule that is sustainable. This is our compromise. You can go faster on your own, if you want. There will always be people to answer questions in Slack.

Our yearly schedule follows the school timetable. We have three terms of approximately 12 weeks, with approximately 2 weeks between each term and a 6 week break over summer.

We work in small groups, which are about 3 people. We try to keep groups together. It's nice to have people to share the journey with. Inevitably some people will drop out and some will move at different speeds. This is fine. Just make sure you communicate so we can shuffle groups as needed.

In-person meetings usually run 6pm-9pm. The first hour is for socializing, and the next two hours are for hands-on learning.


## Attending

You will need a laptop with Scala and a development environment installed. We can help install software. See the [preparation] page for details. Other than that, just show up.

In-person meetings will usually be in central London and have food. Online meetings use [discord][discord].
