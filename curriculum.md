title: Curriculum

We imagine the majority of students will range in experience from completely new to programming to a few years into the job, and our curriculum is aimed at these people. We can teach other things, but our capacity is limited so please discuss first. Effective teaching requires a lot of preparation.


## Goals

Our goals are:

* introduce core programming principles that apply to Scala and other programming languages;
* introduce programming processes, such as editor usage, testing, and version control;
* get some experience with different subfields within the software development industry; and
* be approachable yet rigourous enough that further study is easily accessible.

Note that Scala is the vehicle we use to teach programming, but the concepts are broadly applicable to programming in other languages.


## Details

Our curriculum follows [Creative Scala][creative-scala]. At the time of writing, Creative Scala is being reworked. The description below follows the plan for Creative Scala.

Creative Scala is organized into four parts. Each part introduces new programming techniques within the context of a particular subfield.

1. Part one uses [creative coding][creative-coding] as our vehicle to get started with programming and learn the basics. We create two-dimensional graphics and learn about programming fundamentals.
2. In part two we switch to analysing data, part of what is known as [data science][data-science]. We learn about working with collections of data, defining basic data structures, and visualize data using the skills we learned in the first part.
3. Part three switches to web development. We learn about front- and back-end develompent, creating more complex data, and touch on some of the advanced features of Scala.
4. In our final part we implement a simple programming language, which brings together everything we've learned so far and gives us a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts in programming.
